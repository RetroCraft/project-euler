# Project Euler

Solutions to the Project Euler problems, in whatever languages I feel in the mood to write in.

Java solutions can be run with `run-problem.zsh`.

Mathematica (`.wls`) solutions can be run with `wolframscript` or directly from the command line.
These files also contain code-golfed solutions.
