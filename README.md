# Project Euler

Solutions to the Project Euler problems, in whatever languages I feel in the mood to write in.

Track how many problems have been solved on the auto-generated [markdown file](progress.md).

## Running solutions

Java solutions can be run with `scripts/run-problem.zsh`.

Mathematica (`.wls`) solutions can be run with `wolframscript` or directly from the command line.
These files also contain code-golfed solutions.

Haskell solutions can be run with `runghc` or compiled and run for optimum speed.
