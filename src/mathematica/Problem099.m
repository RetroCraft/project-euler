(*Problem 99: Largest exponential*)


(* ::Text:: *)
(*Comparing two numbers written in index form like 211 and 37 is not difficult, as any calculator would confirm that 211 = 2048 < 37 = 2187.*)
(**)
(*However, confirming that 632382518061 > 519432525806 would be much more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.*)
(**)
(*Using base_exp.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.*)
(**)
(*NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the example given above.*)
